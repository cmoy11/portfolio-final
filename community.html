                    Community engagement and dedication to an equitable world have always been a crucial aspect of my identiy. From my six-year-old self walking the neighborhood collecting cans for Heifer International, to 12 years and over $5,000 to heavy involvement in social justice based organizations in high school and college, giving back has always been important to me.

            <h3>The Michigan Community Scholars Program (MCSP)</h3>
            <p>
                When I first enrolled in the University of Michigan, I knew I was looking for a tight knit community dedicated to social justice. MCSP was exactly that and allowed me to participate in community service projects, intergroup dialogues, leadership trainings, and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts with local community leaders. Now a Sophomore, I serve as a Peer Advisor for Community Service and lead Freshmen in community outreach and reflections.

                In an ongoing effort to integrate data with social justice causes, I serve as an Information Management Coordinator for DMUM, managing the nonprofit's website, donor database, and campaign pages for fundraising and service events. Additionally, I fundraise for and volunteer with C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, participating in the 24 hour dance marathon.

            <h3>State of Michigan Council for Government and Education on Equity and Inclusion</h3>
            <p>
                My Freshman year of college, I had the opportunity to reconnect with my former superintendent, who had sinced moved to Ypsilanti Community Schools. After casual conversation over lunch, she asked me to present with her to the State of Michigan. Drawing on our work with the Okemos equity and inclusion plan, I offered guidance and answered questions regarding equity initiatives to over 50 Michigan public school districts.
